🌍 Climate Risk and Disaster Management Dashboard

📘 Abstract  
The Climate Risk and Disaster Management Dashboard is a front-end web application developed to present climate-related hazards in a clear, visual, and user-friendly manner. The system focuses on key environmental risks such as floods and heat waves while providing structured safety guidelines and response information. This project demonstrates how web technologies can be applied to address real-world societal challenges related to climate awareness and disaster preparedness.

🧭 Introduction  
Climate-related disasters have increased in frequency and severity due to environmental changes, urbanization, and climate variability. Timely access to understandable climate risk information is essential for public safety. However, climate data is often complex and inaccessible to non-technical users.

This project aims to bridge that gap by designing an intuitive web-based dashboard that visually communicates climate risks and corresponding response measures in a simplified and accessible format.

🎯 Project Objectives  
The primary objectives of this project are:
- To design a structured web dashboard for climate risk visualization  
- To improve awareness of flood and heat-related hazards  
- To present emergency response and safety information in a clear format  
- To apply core web programming concepts learned during the semester  

📌 Scope of the Project  
The project focuses on front-end development and user interface design. It does not include backend services or database integration. Weather-related data is fetched using external APIs and is intended for demonstration and educational purposes only. The system is not an official disaster alert platform.

✨ Key Features  
- 🏠 **Home Page:** Overview of climate risks and dashboard purpose  
- 📊 **Risk Dashboard:** Summary of current flood and heat risk levels  
- 🌊 **Flood Risk Module:** Alerts, precautions, relief centers, and recent updates  
- 🔥 **Heat Alert Module:** Temperature visualization, heat index interpretation, and health advisories  
- 🚑 **Response & Safety Module:** Emergency steps, helpline information, and first-aid guidance  
- 📱 **Responsive Design:** Optimized for different screen sizes and devices  

🛠️ Technologies and Tools Used  
- **HTML:** Page structure and semantic layout  
- **CSS:** Styling, layout design, gradients, and responsiveness  
- **JavaScript:** Dynamic content handling and simulated real-time updates  
- **OpenWeather API:** Weather data integration for demonstration purposes  

⚙️ Implementation Approach  
The application follows a modular structure where each major climate risk category is implemented as a separate HTML page. A consistent navigation bar and unified styling ensure a seamless user experience across all sections. CSS enhances visual clarity, while JavaScript enables interactive behavior and dynamic updates.

🌱 Social Impact and Relevance  
This project emphasizes the importance of climate awareness and disaster preparedness. By presenting simplified climate risk information along with safety guidance, the dashboard highlights how web-based solutions can contribute to informed decision-making and community resilience during environmental emergencies.

⚠️ Limitations  
- The data displayed is either simulated or fetched from public APIs and should not be treated as official alerts  
- No backend processing or data storage is implemented  
- The application is developed strictly for academic and educational purposes  

📖 Conclusion  
The Climate Risk and Disaster Management Dashboard demonstrates the practical application of web programming concepts to a socially relevant problem. Through structured design and interactive elements, the project showcases how front-end technologies can be used to visualize climate risks and promote disaster awareness effectively.
